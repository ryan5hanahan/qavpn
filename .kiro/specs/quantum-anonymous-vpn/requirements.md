# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a next-generation VPN system that combines the privacy benefits of traditional VPNs, the anonymity of Tor networks, and the security of end-to-end encrypted messaging applications. The system uses post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure future-proof security, supports both TCP and UDP protocols for flexibility, and implements advanced privacy features including packet sharding, noise injection, and multi-hop routing to achieve complete anonymity between network endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want a VPN that provides complete anonymity and quantum-resistant encryption, so that my communications remain private even against future quantum computing threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL generate post-quantum cryptographic key pairs using CRYSTALS-Kyber or equivalent PQC algorithms
2. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use PQC key exchange protocols to ensure quantum-resistant security
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN all packets SHALL be encrypted using post-quantum symmetric encryption algorithms
4. IF quantum computing advances threaten current encryption THEN the system SHALL remain secure against cryptanalytic attacks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user seeking maximum privacy, I want my network traffic to be completely untraceable, so that no entity can determine my identity or location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routing traffic THEN the system SHALL implement multi-hop routing through at least 3 intermediate nodes
2. WHEN transmitting packets THEN the system SHALL shard packets across multiple routes to prevent traffic analysis
3. WHEN sending data THEN the system SHALL inject random noise packets to obfuscate traffic patterns
4. WHEN establishing connections THEN no single node SHALL have knowledge of both source and destination endpoints
5. IF traffic analysis is attempted THEN the system SHALL provide plausible deniability through noise injection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the VPN to support both TCP and UDP protocols, so that I can optimize performance for different types of network traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support both TCP and UDP transport protocols
2. WHEN handling reliable data transfer THEN the system SHALL use TCP for guaranteed delivery
3. WHEN handling real-time communications THEN the system SHALL use UDP for low-latency transmission
4. WHEN switching protocols THEN the system SHALL maintain security properties across both TCP and UDP

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the VPN to be simple to install and use, so that I can protect my privacy without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the system THEN it SHALL require minimal configuration steps
2. WHEN starting the VPN THEN it SHALL automatically establish secure connections
3. WHEN using the system THEN it SHALL provide a simple command-line interface for basic operations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
5. IF the system fails THEN it SHALL fail securely without leaking user data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-focused user, I want the system to be implemented with minimal code complexity, so that the attack surface is reduced and security auditing is feasible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL use the minimum number of source files necessary
2. WHEN writing code THEN each component SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN designing the architecture THEN it SHALL minimize external dependencies
4. WHEN creating the codebase THEN it SHALL prioritize code clarity and auditability over feature complexity
5. IF additional features are requested THEN they SHALL only be added if they don't compromise the minimal design principle

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want the VPN to run natively on Linux systems, so that I can integrate it with my existing security infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL run on standard Linux distributions
2. WHEN using system resources THEN it SHALL integrate with Linux networking stack efficiently
3. WHEN managing permissions THEN it SHALL work with standard Linux user and group permissions
4. WHEN logging events THEN it SHALL integrate with standard Linux logging mechanisms
5. IF system updates occur THEN the VPN SHALL remain compatible with Linux kernel updates
